    <p>Time to dip our toes into the shallow end of the "how is this even a character" section, kicking things off with Hitman. A mini-uzi and katana-wielding mercenary that can apply unreal amounts of pressure on his opponent. Oddly enough, despite having an SMG, Hitman is primarily a close-range fighter but has so many options to approach each situation that he doesn't suffer from it like some of the others already mentioned.</p>

    <p>Hitman has incredible potential in most matchups but can struggle against true zoners or enemies that can close the gap quickly and relentlessly. Still, he is an excellent choice if you like rushdown fighters that thrive in close-range encounters. While it can be hard to get in on your target from time to time, once you're in, you have so many avenues to take that can set you up for devastating combos that it's hard not to place him over the others listed thus far.</p>
