    <p>Just missing the boat for the top five characters is the one and only Ghostblade, who was the new character added to the final beta and left really good first impressions for most who tried him out. To no one's surprise, Ghostblade is still remarkably good in the game's final release, and with everyone being able to try him out in training mode to find new combo routes and expand on his toolset, he's even better this time around.</p>
    <p>Ghostblade, as his name implies, can summon a ghost at his enemy to open them up, extend combos, or even apply pressure so he can get a quick grab or get into position for another string of attacks. And this is only one aspect of what makes him stand out, as he has incredible range with his katana and dominates the neutral game with far-reaching pokes and strikes. Ghostblade is an excellent character who deserves the praise and hype he's been receiving ever since the beta.</p>
