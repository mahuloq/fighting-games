    <p>Starting the top ten off with a bang is Ranger, one of the few pure zoners in DNF Duel, who uses his dual revolvers to his advantage to keep unrelenting pressure on his opponent from a safe distance. Zoners in DNF Duel are a special breed of chaos. Their normal or heavy attacks will almost always launch projectiles at the enemy, cover tremendous distance, and chain together and into other projectiles allowing you to juggle your opponent with ease while simply staying put on the opposite end of the stage.</p>
    <p>And, yet, while dealing with Ranger can be frustrating, he's not even the game's best zoner by any stretch of the imagination. What he has at his disposal is excellent but very "by the numbers" in terms of what you'd expect a zoner to be in a game like DNF Duel. But, as you will see a bit later, he's just the start of the madness.</p>
