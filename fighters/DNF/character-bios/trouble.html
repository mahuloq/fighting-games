    <p>Troubleshooter, equipped with a greatsword and sawed-off double-barreled shotgun, comes crashing into the top five with style, booze, and incredibly frustrating attacks. Troubleshooter has excellent range on most of his actions, and he can also chuck grenades and an explosive rope net at his opponent to lock them down or force them into an uncomfortable position.</p>
    <p>On top of all of that, almost everything Troubleshooter can do launches his target into the air, allowing him to follow up easily with combos. ~But wait, there's more!~ He can also take swigs from his flask, giving himself grey health, allowing him to deal more damage, and use the game's "Convert" feature to extend his attack strings and set up even more disgusting combos than ever before. Troubleshooter is exceptional at everything he needs to be, making him one of the best.</p>
