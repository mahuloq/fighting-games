    <p>Soaring into the first place spot is the new kid in school, Swift Master, the master of wind and combos. Swift Master is the only character in DNF Duel that can perform all of his Specials while airborne, including his counter, which already gives him a significant advantage over anyone else. On top of that, his attacks also cover lots of ground, allowing him to apply pressure from a safe and manageable distance.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Swift Master can also generate a vortex that pulls his opponent towards him, even if they're blocking, forcing them into uncomfortable or terrible situations if caught off guard. In short, he's straight-up absurd, even for DNF Duel standards. As of now, Swift Master is the clear frontrunner, which can obviously change once more things are discovered for other characters, but he's above and beyond anyone else, and it's almost not even close.</p>
