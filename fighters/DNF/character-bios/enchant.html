<p>Enchantress was one of the last characters revealed for DNF Duel, which showcased her puppeteering abilities and the variety of ways she could decimate you from a distance. Simply put, Enchantress can be annoying to deal with but is one of the more involved characters to try learning, which is her greatest downfall. She may not "wow" you like the other characters in the game, but she will hold her own in battle, which is more than enough.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Enchantress' most significant hurdle is on the player's end, as she might be the most complex character to try learning in the game. Finding ways to implement her oversized death bear, Madd, into her attack strings while also knowing what to do on her end can be pretty strenuous and even harder to pull off in an actual match. However, in capable hands, Enchantress can be horrifying and might even be one of the best in the game. But, as of right now, she joins the camp of "has tremendous potential."</p>
