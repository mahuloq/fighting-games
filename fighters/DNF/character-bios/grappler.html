    <p>Grappler would be an all-star fighter and likely classified as "overpowered" by those met with his wrath if this were any other fighting game. Unfortunately, this is DNF Duel, where every character in the game feels broken to some degree, making it challenging for the Grappler to do what he does best and to its full potential.

        Closing the gap on your opponent is a tough ask in DNF Duel, and the Grappler thrives when getting up close and personal with his opponent. While dodging through projectiles or attacks is an option, having to do that just for a chance of banging out a quick combo can be exhausting, especially since your opposition won't allow you to bully your way in without putting up a fight.</p>
