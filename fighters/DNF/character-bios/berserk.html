    <p>Brutally slashing his way into the top five is Berserker, a rushdown fighter with many tricks up his sleeve that place him in a class of his own. The most crucial aspect of Berserker's playstyle, and part of what makes him unique, is his ability to enter a Frenzied state, which gives him access to new actions and attack strings. One of which is a Bloody Twister, which pulls his opponent in towards him, allowing him to displace them and launch into combos.</p>

    <p>Additionally, when in his Frenzied state, Berserker will also gain a second greatsword, providing more intense combo routes and damage, making him even more formidable than he already is outside of this form. Berserker is a nightmare to deal with and a joy to play at any skill level.</p>
