    <p>Staying on topic with characters who have excellent ranged attacks, let's turn our attention to Vanguard, who uses his lance to become one of the game's best neutral players. While not a zoner by any means, Vanguard has the potential to catch opponents sleeping with incredibly long pokes and jabs that will lead to ridiculous combos if he connects.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, Vanguard also possesses armored attacks that can make it tricky for the opposing player to move in with an attack, as he will just eat the attack, take no damage, and light them up instead. While not the best overall character in DNF Duel, he's a pretty dang solid one and is easy to pick up.</p>
