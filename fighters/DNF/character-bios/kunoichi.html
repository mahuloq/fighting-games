    <p>One of the coolest and best-designed characters in DNF Duel is undoubtedly Kunoichi, a ninja that casts hand seal ninjutsu like a character from Naruto, allowing her to summon in a large flaming toad, fire tornados, fireballs, and much more. Kunoichi is also a blast to play and can be pretty daunting to deal with, but compared to others, she has severe weaknesses that can make many matchups feel like the odds are stacked against you.</p>

    <p>Like Striker and Grappler, Kunoichi's primary attack requires you to get close to your opponent. However, unlike them, her awesome ninjutsu allows her to apply pressure from a safe distance before running up on the opposition, making her one of the best "close-range" fighters in the game. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to move her anywhere near the top because that's an entirely different level of insanity.</p>
