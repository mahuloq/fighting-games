    <p>Horrifying in the first beta, horrifying in the second beta, and (you guessed it) horrifying in DNF Duel's full release is Crusader. Summoning a wall, ricocheting you off of it like a pinball with his great hammer, throwing bolts of light at you, you know the drill if you play-tested the betas. While nothing drastic changed with Crusader, he seems a bit "weaker" since the second beta and seems much more manageable when facing him, but that doesn't change much considering he's still easily in the top two.</p>
    <p>Crusader's biggest downside, however, is he is the slowest character in the game by far, which means he can -and most likely will- fall off after a short while after everyone figured out how to play against him. But, for now, Crusader remains where he's been since the first beta, as one of the game's best characters.</p>
