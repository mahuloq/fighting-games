    <p>When Striker lands one hit on you, you may as well put your pad or stick down and get a sip of water, maybe go for a walk, because the next minute will be one continuous combo string that seemingly never ends. Now, you may be wondering why she's so low on this list if this is the case, and the answer is -much like in Grappler's case- she has to constantly be in her opponent's face to get anything going.

        Striker is an enjoyable character to play and can be imposing against people who have yet to form a solid strategy around her playstyle. However, she falls short in many ways, making her pressure seem disjointed against anyone with even a little range. Most fighters have ranged options, even outside of zoners, so things will quickly become an uphill battle when you lack anything to answer back with, like in Striker and Grappler's case.</p>
