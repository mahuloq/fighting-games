    <p>Next up is our female priest, Inquisitor, who wants to condemn you for any wrongdoing you may have done. Her ability to stop you dead in your tracks by summoning an enormous flaming wheel with the largest hitbox you may have ever seen makes her such a strong character with just one ability. This action locks you into a guard state for several seconds or hits you for massive damage if you were unfortunately caught within the spokes of hell.</p>
    <p>Aside from her death wheel, Inquisitor has access to many other actions that allow her to maintain pressure and execute combos efficiently and quickly. She's effective at accomplishing her goal: to keep her opponent locked down, constantly guessing, and punish them the moment they whiff or make a mistake. She may not be the most exciting character to play or watch in DNF Duel, but she's sure one of the best and more efficient.</p>
