    <p>Now it's time to get into the top three characters of DNF Duel, the characters that make us want to take our ball and go home for the day. Unless, of course, we're playing them. Kicking us off is Launcher, who is the other true zoner of the game and uses a variety of guns to keep her opponent in check across the arena. Think of Ranger from earlier, amplify that by ten, and you get Launcher.</p>
    <p>Launcher uses everything from rocket launchers to chain guns to railguns and mostly everything between, which allows her to pull out a new shiny weapon for just about any situation. If that wasn't enough, Launch also possesses a counter, which works on every attack and even grabs, forcing her opponent to respect how they approach her. Anything and everything Launcher needs to thrive as a zoner, she has and then some, which is precisely why she is placed so high.</p>
