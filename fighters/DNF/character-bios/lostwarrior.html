    <p>Lost Warrior is the only unlockable character in the game, and the effort it takes to obtain him is well worth it as he is also an incredibly competent and strong fighter. He packs a punch with his abilities, dealing excessive amounts of damage with each Special Attack, and can even freeze his opponent in place for a prolonged period of time if he successfully applies enough stacks of his debuff on his opponent. So, what's keeping him out of the top five?</p>
<p>Well, as with most gimmick characters, he is tricky to get the hang of and can be pretty predictable after a while, especially when the vast majority of his attacks have him teleport across the screen. While this sounds cool and advantageous, DNF Duel's "Guard Button" allows you to negate his mix-up potential entirely and punish accordingly. Despite this, Lost Warrior is still one of the strongest characters in the game and the most fun to play due to how much stuff he has at his disposal and his raw damage output. We just wish his gimmicks didn't fizzle out so fast.</p>
